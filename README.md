# TECHNIQUES FOR PROCEDURAL LEVEL GENERATION IN ROGUELIKE GAMES
The objective of this bachelor's thesis is the investigation, analysis, application and development of the main techniques and algorithms to generate 2D maps procedurally. These generated maps are intended for Roguelike games, but can be used for any 2D video game. 
This techniques are: 

- Drunkard's Walk
- Diffusion limited aggregation
- Binary space partitioning
- Voronoi diagrams
- Cellular automatas
- Perlin noise
- Wave function collapse

It was developed with Unity 2021.3.11f1.
